title: Teleoperation of Humanoid Robots A Survey
description: Teleoperation of humanoid robots enables the integration of the cognitive skills and domain expertise of humans with the physical capabilities of humanoid robots.
The operational versatility of humanoid robots makes them the ideal platform for a wide range of applications  when teleoperating in a remote environment. 
However, the complexity of humanoid robots imposes challenges for teleoperation, particularly in unstructured dynamic environments with limited communication.
Many advancements have been achieved in the last decades in this area, but a comprehensive overview is still missing.
This survey paper gives an extensive overview of humanoid robot teleoperation, presenting the general architecture of a teleoperation system and analyzing the different components.
We also discuss different aspects of the topic, including technological and methodological advances, as well as potential applications.

#### <strong>Special Focus</strong>: We would especially like to highlight emerging and underexplored areas of human and model-in-the-loop learning, such as employing humans to seek richer forms of feedback for data than labels alone, learning from dynamic adversarial data collection with humans employed to find weaknesses in models, learning from human teachers instructing computers through conversation and/or demonstration, investigating the role of humans in model interpretability, and assessing social impact of ML systems. We aim to bring together interdisciplinary researchers from academia and industry to discuss major challenges, outline recent advances, and facilitate future research in these areas.
